        <p>An educational strand is a series of clearly defined courses focused on a specific academic topic. These strands provide students an opportunity to expand their knowledge with courses not traditionally available within our Program's general offerings.In
            the Philippines, students can choose from five different strands: Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM), Humanities-Education-Social Sciences (HESS or HUMSS),Business-Accountancy-Management (BAM or ABM),Technical-Vocational-Livelihood
            (TVL), and General Academic Strand (GAS).</p>
        <p> Choosing a strand helps us because we are given a decision so that we can focus on the work we are going to do. This is the way for them to know the hardships in their future, and it gives us an opportunity for our future work. It also builds
            us to prove that we know that life is difficult when we have a job, so there is a choice of strand so that we can hurry for the job we will get. It helps to facilitate our understanding of the course we will face because it is our dream. We
            are giving this help so that we can quickly get the job we want because we also know that it is not easy to get a job.</p>
